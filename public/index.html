          Bp Tracker is designed to support awareness by helping users log and
          observe blood pressure trends over time. Consistent tracking can make
          it easier to notice patterns early and have more informed discussions
          with healthcare professionals.

      <p>
        High blood pressure, often called the
        <strong class="highlight">silent killer</strong>, is a common condition
        that affects the arteries. It occurs when the force of blood against the
        artery walls remains consistently high, causing the heart to work harder
        over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the major risks of hypertension is that it usually develops
        <strong>without noticeable symptoms</strong>. Many people feel
        completely normal even while long-term damage may be occurring inside
        the body.
      </p>

      <p>
        Persistent high blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of
        serious health complications, including heart disease, silent strokes,
        kidney damage, and stress on other vital organs.

      <h2>Understanding Blood Pressure Readings</h2>

      <p>
        Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is
        recorded using two numbers. The first number reflects pressure during a
        heartbeat, while the second represents pressure between beats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Medical guidelines commonly group blood pressure readings into general
        categories ranging from normal levels to more severe stages of
        hypertension, based on long-term health risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Extremely high readings may require urgent medical attention. Regular
        monitoring helps ensure that unusual or concerning patterns are not
        overlooked.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Regular Monitoring Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Because hypertension often progresses quietly, routine blood pressure
        checks are an important part of general health awareness. Many
        guidelines recommend periodic screening for adults, even in the absence
        of symptoms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lifestyle factors such as physical activity, sleep quality, nutrition,
        and stress management play a role in overall cardiovascular health.
        Monitoring blood pressure can support healthier long-term habits and
        timely professional care when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Educational guidance from major medical institutions emphasizes
        awareness, consistency, and professional consultation rather than
        self-diagnosis or self-treatment.
